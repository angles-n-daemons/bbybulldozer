bbybulldozer is a Chrome Extension inspiried by Palantir's [Bulldozer](https://github.com/palantir/bulldozer) that continually checks to update or merge a Github PR once activated.

It is most useful when it is difficult to get an org wide deployment of Bulldozer, but you still would like the benefit of not having to repeatedly update or check a PR that has passed all of the required reviews/checks.
